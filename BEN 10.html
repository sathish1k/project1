    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Ben 10 is an American media franchise conceived by Man of Action, produced by Cartoon <br> Network Studios, and owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment. The franchise revolves <br> around a young boy named Ben Tennyson, who discovers the Omnitrix — a high-tech <br>, extraterrestrial device shaped like a wristwatch. This remarkable gadget contains <br> the DNA of various alien species, allowing Ben to transform into them at will. <br> <br> Initially, the Omnitrix features ten alien transformations, but over <br> time, Ben gains the ability to unlock additional species.
        The franchise has  <br> garnered considerable critical acclaim, securing three Emmy Awards. <br> It encompasses five primary television series, five feature films, and numerous <br> video games. It ranks as Cartoon Network's second longest existing  franchise. <br><br> Furthermore, Ben 10 has inspired a line of toys produced initially <br> by Bandai for the franchise's first four series and later by Playmates Toys <br> for the reboot. Overall, the franchise has amassed over $6 billion in retail sales.
        <br>On February 17, 2021, Cartoon Network announced three 44-minute specials slated  <br> for April  2021, titled Ben 10,010, Ben Gen 10, and Alien X-Tinction. These specials serve <br> as both the series finale for the 2016 reboot and a crossover event  involving  the first four <br> television series in the franchise.</p>
